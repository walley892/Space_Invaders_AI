You can also play with Billy's parameters during the run.

Epsilon: the probability that Billy will choose a random action instead of using his Q-function.

Speed: the cooldown between in-run "turns." Note. the lower this value, the faster the simulation will run.

Reward Attribution: This parameter will set the number of turns in the past that Billy will attribute his observed reward from executing an action at a given state.
