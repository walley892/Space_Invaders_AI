This is Billy, an old project that I decided to pick up again.

Billy uses reinforcement learning to play (an imitation of) Space Invaders.

The src/ directory contains all of the source files, including the Space Invaders implementation. 

src/model/RobotPlayer.java contains the reinforment learning algorithms. Namely, SARSA and Q-Learning were implemented using Linear Function Approximation. 



The archive-bad/ directory contains the old project master files, which was my first ever attempt at reinforcement learning.
